# curve-to-coordinates-
This program converts a curve into a series of coordinates and generates a PNG image by considering the bottom-left corner as the origin. It produces 5000 pairs of coordinates that represent the curve, which are then plotted on a graph. In cases where the curve is not plotted correctly, the program allows for adjustments to the kernel value of the Gaussian blur to refine the image. This process ensures accurate visualization of the curve based on the given data.
